<p><span style="font-size: 108%">Eckhart Tolle (The Power of Now):</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E"><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AWM1ECF2OW56/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1577314808&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books">Not a book for the mind - a book to teach you to be free</a> </span><span style="font-size: 108%"></strong>&ldquo;</span><span style="color: #0E0E0E">After nearly three decades of practicing meditation to become enlightened (some day) I found it disheartening to conclude that I wasn&apos;t really getting anywhere, yet I was reluctant to give up the effort. Then Tolle popped into my life like a much needed life preserver, showed me who I really am, and put an end to my thrashing about in self-created whirlpools of despair - when you discover you are the ocean itself the whirlpools peter out in embarrassment. Don&apos;t read this book in order to feed your mind, stroke your ego or validate your beliefs. Read it in order to learn to free yourself from pain and delusion&hellip; Are you willing to let go of everything and to simply BE and let life unfold naturally?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;Tolle presents the material as if he has pulled out all of these amazing tools for enlightenment out of a hat, like some kind of magician&apos;s rabbit. In my opinion, that is just a little dishonest&hellip; Tolle has this really terrible habit of making simple mindfulness much more mystical than it actually is. It&apos;s a little misleading. And he makes the mind sound Evil with a capital &quot;E.&quot; He should have emphasized more strongly that it is not our thoughts and emotions, but our relationship to them that is the problem&hellip; Tolle clearly wrote this for an audience that has never studied Hinduism and Buddhism, and that&apos;s fine. Everyone needs an introduction. I just wish that he had come clean that that was what he had learned, what he decided to teach, and not mislead his readers into believing that he came out of some vacuum in space, fully formed and fully enlightened.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E"><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RBZDJP3FL2A1/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1577314808&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books">Clear, Intelligent, Gentle</a> </strong>&ldquo;Although I have always felt myself to be vaguely spiritual, I had never bought a book on spirituality before, shunned anything that smacked of religion, and wouldn&apos;t be caught dead in the New Age section. However, a friend recommended Tolle&apos;s book, and I found myself completely absorbed in it from beginning to end&hellip; Not only does it illuminate the fundamental, slippery, destructive patterns of the mind or ego which confound one&apos;s spiritual and even physical well-being, but it also provides a variety of simple and practical techniques for breaking down and dissolving these various forms of mental pollution.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;The book showed me that I have a pretty thick mold of the mind to break through, and it took me very far on the first day, even farther after that. The message went beyond what I would probably recognize on my own. After all, I was (and still am but to a lesser degree) one of those constant thinkers who mistakenly believe that it&apos;s good to think all the time but almost never stop to see, hear and feel the essence of being&hellip; . The most immediate effect for me was that focusing into the present moment helped me communicate better. I began to listen more intensely, meaningfully and less judgmentally than before&hellip; In short, I don&apos;t need to search for the truth anymore. I got lucky on the first try, by becoming a little curious with the book that seemed unassuming and light in physical weight. Thank you, Eckhart.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;Tolle, like so many other pop-spiritual authors on the Western marketplace bookshelves of &quot;Self Help&quot;, &quot;Philosophy &amp; Spirituality&quot;, etc. titles, has taken the teachings of the Buddha (+/- 2400 years old) and edited them as original ideas of his own&hellip; This book, like so many others, is the equivalent of a quick-fix pill common to the modern mindset of the average American/European reader. The &quot;answer&quot; is not in the medication, but in the taking of it AND then changing one&apos;s lifestyle to prevent the same dis-ease from occurring again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;The first third of this book, the one that sets up the theme to which the title refers, is good. It basically states that the majority of our pain comes from our focus on the past (guilt, regret, blame, anger etc.) or the future (stress, anxiety, worry). The only thing we can impact, and the only thing that is truly real, is the now. Tolle encourages us to focus on the present moment, and he gives us ways that we can settle our thinking mind in favor of just being in the Now&hellip; then the book devolves into New Age mumbo-jumbo as he tries to encompass everything from improving marital relationships to improving our immune systems to ending world hunger. He makes grand statements as if they&apos;re fact, without supporting them in any way, and then goes on for a page building on those statements.&rdquo;</span></p>

Seek Not Here...</a> &ldquo;</strong>This book is great at describing the problems of having negative emotions and how they can rule our minds. But the one big problem with The Power of Now is that it doesn&apos;t really address the root cause of why we have negative emotions in the first place. Furthermore, the author doesn&apos;t necessarily encourage the reader to really look at those negative emotions and examine why you have them&hellip; If this type of New Age teaching is working for you than you should probably stick to that; it&apos;s not everyone&apos;s time to know the truth. I&apos;m just putting this out there for those looking to go deeper, for those feeling restless in their spirituality despite all their readings in the &quot;spiritual buffet line&quot; and still feeling like you have unanswered questions and that something is missing, as I once did back in the day.&rdquo;</span></p>

With facing the truth about what I wanted from my life, no matter how crazy it might have sounded&hellip; I read all the self-help books from my Dad&apos;s shelves, all the Tony Robbins and Brian Tracy and Zig Ziglar, and I loved it. I bought my own books, `Change Your Thinking&apos;, `Authentic Happiness&apos;, `How To Change Your Life in 30 Days&apos;. I&apos;d sit and have coffee and read and journal and dream, but I just couldn&apos;t figure out how to get from where I was to `there&rsquo;&hellip; The real me, the one I&apos;ve been hiding without knowing it, thinking won&apos;t be good enough, is coming out to play.&rdquo;</span></p>

I have bought quite a few over the years (and there is a part of me that really wants them to help me) but I am often left disappointed. I have the feeling that &quot;it might work for you&quot; but you don&apos;t know what stuff is happening in my life! This book has been a revelation (okay, I didn&apos;t see angels and hear twinkly music) but this book has concrete, genuine tools that can help a person love themselves more than they do right now&hellip; I was attracted to the book because the cover is not a cheesy-looking field of flowers with happy people running. The cover and title gave me an inkling that this book might be for the modern man. With such a low price, I thought it was worth a go.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #B54104"><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R355MOWCIKX08Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1478121734">Light At The End of the Tunnel</a> </span><span style="color: #0E0E0E"></strong>&ldquo;Almost all of my self-esteem has a direct correlation to what others think of me&hellip; My body feels toxic and diseased from the lack of love that I feel&hellip; Reading LOVE YOURSELF was like finally being able to see that proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. I think what makes it so easy to absorb is that it keeps out the typical &quot;noise&quot; you see in other self-help type of books (i.e. religion, use of prescription drugs, Ph.D. lingo, therapy psycho-babble).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;I&apos;ve read books on this subject before: books stuffed with so much material that I find myself skimming, impatient for the meat of it all. I read &quot;Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It&quot; in one sitting. Then I read it again&hellip; The exercises that Kamal provides are straightforward, efficient, and only require practice, diligence, and a little trust. You can start right away and feel differently about yourself within minutes.&rdquo;</span></p>

While those works made perfect sense to me and have tremendous amounts of truth in them, it means nothing if you don&apos;t learn to love yourself. Simply put, if you don&apos;t &quot;Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It,&quot; then you simply will not HAVE a life--at least not one worth living--and no amount of &quot;presence&quot; or &quot;positive vibes,&quot; as Tolle and Byrne suggest in their works, will make any significant change for you.&rdquo;</span></p>

If you strive to be a better version of you, you owe it to yourself to read this book.&rdquo;</span></p>

He has the graphs to prove it.&rdquo;</span></p>

Painfully honest. Tells you about how he made money, lost it all and hit rock bottom, and how he raised himself through it to become a major figure in media on the internet.

He chose himself&hellip; James shows how to create real wealth and happiness, how to create your own destiny.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;It is a manifesto for those of us who are down but not completely out&hellip; if you choose to believe in yourself, then you have made the first step toward success&hellip; In the end, it&apos;s really all about believing in yourself and having the faith to jump into a new system that promises inner and external wealth.

It just so happens that he has figured out a powerful way to overcome the type of major adversities that often keep people feeling like they&apos;re being water-boarded by life&hellip; Any one of the dozens of ideas in Choose Yourself are easily worth 100x the price of the book.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;I don&apos;t know what I was expecting - maybe a way to be a better version of myself? A pep-talk in a book? However, this one read more like self help cloaked in marketing. I know Mr. Altucher is known for being somewhat of a marketing genius but it seemed overdone in this one. If you can get past that, it&apos;s not that bad but I didn&apos;t feel like I got a ton out of it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E"><strong>Gorilla Mindset</strong>:</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;Unoriginal: Very little of the advice in the book is that new or original, and a lot of it is extremely generic. For example, the chapter on money talks about investing in index funds, the chapter on weight loss talks about eating natural foods and minimizing starch and dairy, and the chapter on self-talk talks about being positive. This is all good advice, but as a compulsive reader, investor, and fitness fanatic, this is extremely basic (all of it is probably the advice you would get on page 1 if you picked up a book on any of those respective topics)&hellip; Most books I found groundbreaking would bring up some controversial ideas, develop each in a lot of detail, then connect this to a new idea in a series of logical steps (&quot;So Good They Can&apos;t Ignore You&quot; by Cal Newport is a great example), but this book gave a number of half baked ideas, provided minimal evidence, then jumped on to something new&hellip; Scientific research was minimal and almost laughable (Mike brought on &quot;experts&quot; and simply had them verify all of his opinions-he never actually challenged his ideas).&rdquo;</span></p>

For instance, one of the best pieces of advice that I needed to hear was saying &quot;no&quot; to everything.

I believe he said somewhere that he is a millionaire. Mike lives the life he wants, and shows you how to live the life you want&hellip; Mike defines his terms, so nothing in the book is vague. He then gives you understandable, actionable steps to follow all of his advice. He covers mindset, frame control, state control, and even self-talk. (I read &quot;What To Say When You Talk To Yourself&quot; alongside Gorilla Mindset, and found Mike&apos;s book to be the better book on the topic)&hellip; In each section, Mike gives you exercises to find yourself out.

The good news is that you can see results quickly&hellip; Out of the suggestions I implemented, I have had the best/fastest results with controlling my mood and reframing my thoughts. I would have paid the full cost of the book for these two chapters alone. It only took me a week or so to notice a huge shift in how I feel and how I approach each day and moment. I&apos;ve always known that I&apos;m a pessimistic person, but previously I hadn&apos;t realized the extent of my negativity and how much my thoughts affect my mood. Likewise, I hadn&apos;t realized how much my mood affects how much I accomplish. I previously assumed that bad moods would pass on their own, and I never tried to do much to control how I was feeling or what I was thinking about&hellip; I&apos;ve been most resistant about implementing the self-talk suggestions. I feel like an idiot doing this. Talking to myself makes me laugh though, which does improve my mood. I&apos;m going to assume this is one of those things that takes practice and will seem less goofy at some point.

<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;I have been following Mike on twitter for a while and enjoy his trolling antics (Seth Rogen getting publicly cuckolded was hilarious) but was reluctant to purchase a book on mindset in general, let alone one written by a twitter troll&hellip; My mind is always wondering and I have trouble even focusing on conversation if it&apos;s not critically important. I thought that was just the way I was wired and had never even though about trying to do anything about it but I&apos;ve already found his suggestion of checking in and doing &quot;mind warm up&quot; as a helpful means of focusing on what I&apos;m interested.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;The chapter on Self-Talk was the most helpful to me.

Also, which is important, the book doesn&apos;t promise quick and easy gimmicks or promotes selfishness and egoism by emphasizing &quot;the power of egoism&quot; or &quot;how to get what you want&quot;, as sleazy self-help egoism manuals do. It is a superior work of its kind&hellip; All this advice had been given before, and there isn&apos;t much new that the author adds. Calling common-sense / CBT advice &quot;achieving a gorilla mindset&quot; is perhaps a marketing trick, but it adds nothing new, no more than similar books which talk about unleashing your inner giant / Attila the Hun / zen master / TNT / philosopher, to give the titles of a few similar books from years past.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E"><strong>How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;I wouldn&apos;t resell it for twice what I paid&hellip; I really enjoyed Scott&apos;s independent thinking and challenges of conventional wisdom throughout this book, especially as it contrasts with other self-help, goal-setting or business advice books. For instance, choosing an opportunity for which one has some sort of inherent advantage rather than blindly prescribing &quot;you can do whatever you want&quot; appeals to my pragmatic mind&hellip; the road to success is anything but certain when you&apos;re placing bets on what the public wants. Having a system that embraces and anticipates failure, in particular, is an essential tool to avoid letting temporary results bleed over into derailing what could be a highly successful longer-term career choice&hellip; I also appreciated Scott&apos;s thoughts on useful core skills, especially psychology.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone smart and weary of reading tired cliches in the self-help genre.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;His humility is a welcome relief from much of the Success literature.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;Reading the book was akin somewhat to how I think it would be like to have the good fortune of knowing a sharp, successful, resolute person who was willing to share his thoughts, over time and many coffee get-togethers, on his success and life in general&hellip; The value in Adam&apos;s thoughts come in the form of offering his experiences and methods in his own life on making it easier to do the right behaviors, and thus making it easier for him and us to choose the successful habits.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;This book is a powerful argument for the sort of positive attitude so often lacking in the workplace of today&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;I rarely read self-help books.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;I have a weakness for self-help books&hellip; Of course, a great deal of hokum and P.T. Barnum-like salesmanship pervades the field as well. From Norman Vincent Peale to Dale Carnegie to Napoleon Hill to Stephen Covey, we find a middle-brow sources of advice, often over-sold or simplistic, but good for nuggets of wisdom and for exercising the crap-detector&hellip; Nassim Nicolas Taleb provides a good contemporary example of an intellectual who dispenses advice and opinions, not under the guise of self-help, but through thoughtful and entertaining essays that provide can provide benefits&hellip; My inner Taoist had rebelled against goals in a way that I had never been able to quite understand. I&rsquo;ve accomplished things in life, helped raise a family, succeeded in my profession, married well, and so on, without having been a goal-driven person. In fact, I had this inkling that goals were a rather abstract and perhaps in some way faulty way of going about things, and Adams clarified the issue for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;The book starts to lose steam about the time the author starts talking about &quot;affirmations&quot; -- something I associate with the flaky people who follow the advice of the book &quot;The Secret.&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;Why I read this book. Because I am striving to be a successful entrepreneur and I am failing a lot!!!! All I ever keep reading about it successes, so it was a breath of fresh air to see a book that is keeping it real!!! I was so excited. Now having read it, the book wasnt exactly what I had hoped for, but it was about 60% of it. There&apos;s a lot of excess stuff to the &quot;failing&rdquo;.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0E0E0E">&ldquo;This guy gives &quot;advice&quot; on every topic known to man. Most people would be honest and just tell you they are going to share their unfounded opinions, this guy does under the pretext of having some sort of expertise. While some of his suggestions, especially about career, are undoubtedly beneficial, its really just a book of anecdotal experiences and opinions.&rdquo;</span></p>
