<br>
<font color="#000000">Hey,</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Yesterday&apos;s email about research &amp; the <strong><em>Avatar Lie</strong></em> hit a nerve.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Here were a couple of responses that represent the whole:</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><em>&quot;</font><font color="#191919">This is a breath of fresh air. I can&apos;t tell you how many times the &quot;avatar&quot; thing has f*cked me up.&quot;</em></font>
<br>
<font color="#191919"><em>&quot;Can&apos;t wait to hear what&apos;s next. Avatar creation has been a big sticking point here. Cheers&quot;</em></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Truth be told, the only real problem I have with creating an Avatar is that the concept normally trips people up. If it helps you, go for it. But if a concept doesn&apos;t work, don&apos;t be afraid to throw it out the window.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">You hear it all the time -- the market chooses, not you. The only real way to <em>know, </em>is to <em>test</em>. Avatars tend to hold a lot of copywriters back from writing and putting things out in the world.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">And there&apos;s an easier way - as you&apos;ll see in my research process below.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Yesterday, I told you there are research shortcuts.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">These shortcuts are tied to this <strong>RESEARCH MAXIM</strong> (a maxim is short, pithy statement expressing a general truth or rule of conduct.)</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"> </font>
<br>
<center><font color="#000000"><strong>Research Maxim:</strong> </font></center>
<br>
<center><font color="#000000"><strong>The majority of your research has already been done by someone else</strong></font></center>
<br>
<font color="#000000">I don&apos;t care if you&apos;re launching a new product the world has never seen, another writer, marketer, or company has already compiled most of what you need to know (including what you need to know about your customer aka Avatar).</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Someone else has done 90% of the job uncovering pain points and finding solutions (and a lot of times your job is to simply fill in that 10% gap).</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">The research process below will work for a wide-range of people:</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">	&bull;	You have no idea what to create. </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">	&bull;	You have an idea but no product yet. </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">	&bull;	You have a product.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Just take out a pen &amp; piece of paper and follow along.</font>
<br>
<center><font color="#000000"><strong>PHASE ONE: FOCUS YOUR BRAIN </strong></font></center>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Phase One will help you focus your brain on what&apos;s going to be important when you actually start drilling down and researching.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"> </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Based on your Market Sophistication &amp; Awareness Level (explained below), you&apos;ll know what things you&apos;re trying to extract (ie, an ingredient in your product that you can make a secret.) You&apos;ll figure out how you can differentiate your product based on what&apos;s being promised and claimed in the world.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><strong>Step 0: Read books on selling and consumer pyschology</strong></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Apologies for starting you off with a non-step... but this the foundation of any sales message. Understanding sales and pyschology is going to help your entire research process.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">If you don&apos;t have a sound understanding of sales principles, then it&apos;s going to be harder to know what to look for.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">And the best part -- this understanding can eliminate the need for 1 specific Avatar -- if you know sales you&apos;re going to know how to write in a way that will attract just about any Avatar you could cook up.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">For a list of essential books on copywriting &amp; sales, go here: </font><font color="#0F3CC0"><a href="http://copyhour.com/reading-list">http://copyhour.com/reading-list</a></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><strong>Step 1: What&apos;s the product?</strong></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">A) What&apos;s the product you&apos;ll be selling?</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Is it a book, course, physical product, strategy session, etc. Just write down the product type.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">B) Does your product exist already?</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Is it selling or capable of being sold right now?</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Yes or no.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><strong>Step 2: What&apos;s your Market Sophistication?</strong></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Answer this: </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">	1.	Stage 1: Are you first to market? Is your product/service brand new? Your market will have never seen this product before.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">	2.	Stage 2: Are you second-ish to market? You have a newer product but there are a few competitors?</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">	3.	Stage 3: Are you in a market that&apos;s crowded and people are becoming jaded with big claims? </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">If you&apos;re in Stage 1 - first to bring a product to market - all you need to do is tell people what your product can do. Name the Features &amp; Benefits of your product</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">If you&apos;re in Stage 2 - newer product but there are competitors - you need to enlarge your Claims. Make bolder Claims than your competition. Is your product better, faster, stronger than competitors? Put some measurability to it to one up your competitors.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">If you&apos;re in Stage 3 - the market is getting jaded with exaggerated claims - you&apos;ll need to choose a marketing angle which highlights your Features differently. </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"> </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><strong>Step 3: What&apos;s your Medium?</strong></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">How exactly will you be delivering your sales message?</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">A) Will you be selling through an online sales letter (or VSL)? Through a direct mail package? An email series? A phone consultation? Google Adwords banner to a sales page?</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">B) If you&apos;re unsure - what are your direct competitors doing? What are your indirect competitors doing (companies in your market that aren&apos;t selling the same exact product)?</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Don&apos;t reinvent the wheel at this stage. If no one is selling via SnapChat -- it might be an opportunity -- but it might also be a fool&apos;s errand. You can get creative after you&apos;ve got a proven converting funnel in place. </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><strong>Step 4: Loosely pick an Awareness Level</strong></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Based on your Market sophistication above and your Medium -- what Awareness Level do you think you&apos;ll target first? </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Awareness Levels are in </font><font color="#A20008">RED</font><font color="#000000">. This chart will make the most sense to CopyHour members and fans of AWAI.</font>
<br>
<center><font color="#000000">￼</font></center>
<br>
<font color="#000000">If you&apos;re unsure, error on the right side of the scale.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">All Phase One has done is focus your brain on what to look for during your research.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<center><font color="#000000"><strong>PHASE TWO: MARKET &amp; COMPETITIVE RESEARCH</strong></font></center>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Remember our Research Maxim: <strong>The majority of your research has already been done by someone else</strong></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">(Step 5 below is the biggest step in this process. It might seem daunting at first, but when you jump in - it&apos;s actually very simple.)</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"> </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><strong>Step 5: Discovery &amp; Offer Extraction</strong></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">A) Find your direct competitor&apos;s sales materials (competitors selling the same exact type of product as you. ie. An ebook on getting your ex back.)</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Use Adbeat.com if you can&apos;t find them or don&apos;t know who the top companies are.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; Pay closest attention to the sales materials that match your chosen medium (sales letter or VSL).</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; <strong>Hand copy the sales messages of the top 1-3 competitors.</strong></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; Write their headlines and subheadlines down on notecards (1 headline per notecard)</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; Look for their Promises. What are they Promising their product or company can do. Write one Promise on a notecard (the best sales letters will have 1 main promise stated in several different ways. If you can&apos;t find a ton of unique Promises, it&apos;s okay).</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; Look for Claims (a claim is a statement that supports a Promise). Write the Claims that support a Promise on the back of the Promise notecard.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; Now look for Proof that supports the Claims (studies, testimonials, articles, etc.) If there&apos;s room, write these Proof elements on the back of the same Promise notecard.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; Look at their Offer. An Offer is just the Features that make up a product. </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; Write each Feature of their product on a notecard.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; On the backside of your Feature notecard, write the Benefits they say that product provides (there will be overlap with the Promises, Claims, &amp; Proof from above)</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; Look for any unique-to-their-product Objections they handle. What&apos;s an Objection? Read this:</font><font color="#0F3CC0"><a href="https://blog.crazyegg.com/2013/04/24/overcome-objections/">https://blog.crazyegg.com/2013/04/24/overcome-objections/</a></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; Look for customer demographics if possible (&quot;Are you a senior over 65?&quot;). Write these down on a notecard.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">B) (Especially if you don&apos;t have direct competitors) Look at indirect competitors -- the top 1-3 most successful companies in the same market that don&apos;t have the same product type.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Repeat the steps above.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are brand new, first to market... and you don&apos;t have any other competitors to look at... look at other companies who are using the same Medium as you who you&apos;d like to model.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Use the steps above - especially the handwriting of their sales message in order to get a deeper understanding of how they&apos;re selling.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><strong>STEP 6: Deep(er) Dive</strong></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Doing the above should give you about 60-80% of the research you&apos;ll need.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">In this stage you&apos;re going deeper. Remember what your brain should be focused on from PHASE ONE.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">A) Find studies related to your product. Look for scientific journals. Write interesting facts &amp; discoveries down on notecards (remember what you&apos;re looking for)</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">B) Gather your testimonials (if you have them)</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">C) Gather 3rd party credibility you could use (ie &quot;The New York Times said, &apos;X,y,z&apos;.&quot;)</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">C) Conduct surveys (if possible). Survey your audience a la Ryan Levesque&apos;s Ask Method.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">D) Read blogs &amp; articles that cover your topic both directly and indirectly (Again looking for Headlines, Promises, Claims, and Proof).</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">E) Read forum posts and Reddit discussions taking notes.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">F) Look for STORIES during this entire process. What stories could you tell?</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"> </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Put everything on notecards.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">At this stage in the game, you&apos;ve knocked out your competitive research and gathered a lot of information. Start flipping through your notecards (and I got this from Gary Halbert) saying, &quot;Hmmm... interesting.&quot;</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<center><font color="#000000"><strong>PHASE THREE: YOUR PRODUCT &amp; OFFER</strong></font></center>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><strong> </strong></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><strong>Step 7: Build your offer</strong></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">A) Consume your product. Read it. Use it. Get it delivered and open it. </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Read through the course/book at least once. </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">B) Read it again</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; Take note of the Features of the product. Put each Feature on its own notecard. </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; On the backside, write out potential Benefits that Feature can provide to the customer. Those Benefits are your Claims. What&apos;s a piece of supporting Proof you can give to that claim. Write it down.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">You want everything on a note card so you can just flip through them.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">--&gt; Take note of any stories or unique ancedotes you find. What Objections do you see addressed within your product? (ie, &quot;But what if I&apos;m busy?&quot; Well, chapter 2 talks about solving a certain issue in 5 minutes).</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Now you have your Offer -- a list of your Features, their Benefits (Claims + Proof) -- and you have your Objections. </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">C) If you don&apos;t have a product at this point, build what would be an &quot;Ideal Offer&quot;</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">What Features would you include in an ideal world? Put them on notecards.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Don&apos;t judge just yet, you likely won&apos;t be able to include all the Features you&apos;ve made up in this Ideal Offer. You can remove Features you&apos;re incapable of creating later.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"> </font>
<br>
<center><font color="#000000"><strong>PHASE FOUR: THINK THEN REST </strong></font></center>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><strong>Step 8: Say &quot;Hmm...&quot;</strong></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Constantly flip through your competitor&apos;s notecards and your Offer notecards. </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">&quot;Mind the gaps&quot; - what Features do they have that you don&apos;t? What Promises are they making that you can&apos;t?</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">The gap might be where your opportunity is. The gap might signal the differentiation that you can point to.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">The gap might signal that you need to add more Features to your Offer (or maybe you could build a bonus report).</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><strong>Step 9: Rest</strong></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">At this point you&apos;ve done a lot and you have a lot to consider. It&apos;s time to let your unconsious brain take over. </font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">This will be an individual experience but get out of the office. Go exercise.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Take the week or the weekend off of writing and researching.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Inspiration will hit at some point. When it does, listen to it.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Go write using the Sales Message Oultine structure I&apos;ve provided in CopyHour.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">+++++</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">And that&apos;s it!</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">This has been my research process for years -- I&apos;m just now taking the time to fully document what I do.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">I think this is a lot less scary and more empowering than &quot;Avatars&quot;.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">What do you think?</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Let me know!</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Vayamos,</font>
