title: A New Post
excerpt: Is this all it takes?
---

<p>Mother mother mother mother mother fucker! Gahh!!!!! Wow, my fingers feel like sludge. I haven&rsquo;t typed in so long. I have been journaling by hand for a while, so I have lost some of the muscle memory I once had for my keyboard. It is currently a little bit more of a struggle to type at a quick pace. </p>
<p>But anyway, that&rsquo;s not at all the reason why I&rsquo;m trying to get my words out on paper right now. No. The reason I am journaling here on my computer right now is because my mind feels completely full, and yet completely senseless all at once. </p>
<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t know what to say. Lately, I have felt like my mind is far less sharp, more mushy than ever before in my life. I am not thinking critically on a daily basis. I am not having to express my own thoughts in my own words. I read&hellip; I consume information&hellip; I get excited by ideas almost every single day. And yet I don&rsquo;t do any work to make them my own. I don&rsquo;t do the hard work needed to transform the ideas into my own words. I don&rsquo;t take Bill Bonner&rsquo;s ideas, for example, and make them my own. I don&rsquo;t re-articulate them in my own words. And thus, when I find myself wanting to &mdash; whether that&rsquo;s in a conversation or in writing &mdash; I struggle. </strong></p>
<p>Take my conversation with Rory just now. I struggled to express what I was thinking. I struggled to express what I was and am feeling. The feeling of overwhelm that I have from watching that documentary. On the one hand, I am completely fascinated by that world of propaganda and mass persuasion. On the other hand, it terrifies me. It terrifies me because of the responsibility that comes with it. You are shaping people&rsquo;s opinions. You are an opinion maker. You are helping people shape how they lead their lives. Do you really know what&rsquo;s good for them? No! How can I? I can&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s really good for people. Or maybe I can, but I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;d know. And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ready to believe that it would be good for anyone if I tried to make them live in a way I thought was best. I am critical of the central planner. I am almost <em>disgusted</em> by the central planner. And yet, aren&rsquo;t advertisers central planners in a way? Isn&rsquo;t propaganda a critical part of central planning? </p>
<p>Propaganda is about spreading an idea. It&rsquo;s about disseminating a particular worldview. Conditioning people to accept things that you want them to accept&hellip; so that they&rsquo;ll behave in a way you want them to behave. </p>
<p>That scares me a little bit. Copywriting presupposes knowing what is good for a person. It means you know what they want, and you are confident that helping the person get what they want is really a good thing. But is it? I don&rsquo;t know. Is it a good thing to <em>not</em> help them get what they want? Probably not. Neither is good nor bad but thinking makes it so. </p>
<p><em>Shit. That documentary last night even put my obsession with self-help into perspective. I try to change myself because perhaps I feel powerless in the world. I feel that I have no power to affect change outside myself, in the world around me, so I turn inward. I try to control myself instead. Either way, action presupposes I know what&rsquo;s good for me. At least, it presupposes I know what I want. To act intelligently means knowing what I want and having a goal. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m just drifting on the ocean. That frightens me too. Living here forever. Being a hermit as I have been. It doesn&rsquo;t spell a happy future. </em></p>
<p><span style="color: #FF0000">I don&rsquo;t want Ryan Markish&rsquo;s life. I don&rsquo;t want too have a big house. Kids. A wife. And only in my mid-thirties! I don&rsquo;t want to settle like that. It&rsquo;s the future I have never wanted. And yet, that&rsquo;s what I see among the people ten years ahead of me. They are all having kids. They are all settled. They are all &ldquo;employed.&rdquo; None of them seem particularly happy. </span></p>
<p>Probably the happiest person &mdash; at least the most &ldquo;apparently&rdquo; happy person I can think of is Max from RSD. He seems to really enjoy life. He seems to be always positive. And the amazing thing is that it&rsquo;s a choice he made. He <em>chose</em> and <em>chooses</em> to be positive all the time. </p>
<p>Fuck. You know what? I have gotten very good at journaling. I have gotten very good at free writing. It&rsquo;s a skill I have become very adept at. But it&rsquo;s not getting me anywhere now. I am having a conversation with myself alone. That&rsquo;s the most self-contained conversation I could ever have. I am an audience of one. But there are more people in the world than just me!</p>
<p>I think the writing is a good thing! It&rsquo;s great that I &ldquo;write&rdquo; as much as I do (if you can call this &ldquo;writing&rdquo;). But it is not exactly &ldquo;communication.&rdquo; I have gotten quite adept at writing 1000 words every day in my journal. But there is probably a more productive way I could be using those 1000 words. </p>
<p>As they say, it takes the same amount of effort to build a lemonade stand as it does a billion dollar business. Sure, it&rsquo;s an oversimplification, but I think there&rsquo;s a kernel of truth there. Here&rsquo;s the truth: I can apply my effort into looking at my navel, fucking talking to myself all the time, repeating the same old patterns over and over again in my journal&hellip; or I can expend that energy trying to actually connect with other people. I can start conversations online. I can write emails to friends. I can share what I am learning with <em>other </em>people. And if I don&rsquo;t, where do I get myself in the end?</p>
<p>Is life really going to be different a year from now if I don&rsquo;t create any new relationships? If I don&rsquo;t try to share my ideas with other people? If I don&rsquo;t ask questions of other people and not just myself? I feel like I&rsquo;m just navel gazing with all these journals. Instead of taking action, I navel gaze in my journal. I fantasize and repeat the same old things over and over to myself. Is it useful? Is it really getting me anywhere? I don&rsquo;t think so. Not really. I suppose it keeps me aware. But at the same time, it might be a way in which I am getting in my own way. </p>
<p>For example, I get <em>so many</em> ideas that I cannot even maintain a constant habit in my life. In my journals I always come up with new &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; to try out in my life. Instead of trying to simplify, I constantly try to optimize. This leads to no habits at all. It means that I try to change my habits and routines so often that I don&rsquo;t have any habits to speak of. I don&rsquo;t wake up consistently at a specific time. I don&rsquo;t have consistent bedtime. I don&rsquo;t read as much as I&rsquo;d like. I don&rsquo;t study copy to the extent I&rsquo;d like. All the things I know I &ldquo;should&rdquo; do, I don&rsquo;t. Or I leave it to whim. I let myself get distracted.</p>
<p>But I now have the experience to realize that there really are some <em>simple</em> habits that make my life better, even if they aren&rsquo;t the &ldquo;best&rdquo; habits. Which am I talking about? I mean habits like waking up without an alarm. Going to bed early. Leaving my laptop at work. Simply not having the option to be on my computer in the evenings and on the weekends makes a big difference in my quality of life and quality of thinking. I read much more when I don&rsquo;t have my computer constantly at hand. I am less distracted. I waste less time reading bullshit online. I am calmer and more focused. Those things may not be &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; but I think they are worthwhile. </p>
<p>Going to bed before 9pm. Letting myself wake up naturally. These are good for my health and productivity. Same for leaving my computer at work. And I just said this. We can move on now.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think I was trying to say that perhaps I should redirect this writing energy to something more productive. Instead of writing 1000 words in my journal every day, I could write 1000 words in blog comments or on forums. I could be writing and communicating with friends. Writing to myself this way doesn&rsquo;t lead me to have to work hard to communicate well. I can write like a madman, with no sense of structure or style or anything. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Because no one is going to read this. But if I were trying to communicate with another person, I&rsquo;d have to work harder to make a point. I&rsquo;d have to capture their attention. I&rsquo;d have to provide value. I&rsquo;d have to be clear. In these pages, none of those measures apply. </p>
<p>These journals just ramble on and on and go nowhere. They don&rsquo;t have a point. They are purely for me. But what good do they do? </p>
<p>I think I need to be able to see when things aren&rsquo;t helping me, and move on. Does journaling this much really help me get more fit, or more healthy, or more wealthy? No, I don&rsquo;t think it does. It just gives me the feeling of being full of ideas. But writing in my journal for an hour every day is not really productive. It&rsquo;s useful because it keeps me accountable. It helps me to clarify my thoughts. But it doesn&rsquo;t really do anything productive. </p>
<p>And hey, just because I think I might benefit from doing it less doesn&rsquo;t mean I have to stop completely. I can still do it once a week or so. But every day for an hour? Maybe too much. Imagine what I could do with that extra hour every day each week! What if, instead of journaling like this every day of the week, I instead stuck to a simpler version of a daily journal. One in which I keep track of metrics (like workouts, food intake, productive actions, etc.) instead of rambling like a maniac. Then on the weekends I could word vomit like this to reflect on and plan the next week. During the week I could just work off a basic checklist and a few simple questions to ask myself every day to &ldquo;check in.&rdquo; There are already some questions I have from Tony Robbins. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so much shit. I want so much. I want to be and do so much, that I get paralyzed. I don&rsquo;t know what to do first (sometimes). But really I do know what to do first. As soon as I said I don&rsquo;t know, I realized I do. I know that first, I need to get myself financially secure. That means money in the bank and financially valuable skills. I need to set myself up for success. I am not living like YOLO. There&rsquo;s a plan, and purpose, behind how I am approaching life. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Ryan Holiday journals this much. He might journal a little bit, but probably nothing like this. WOuldn&rsquo;t it be better to keep track of key metrics that would actually allow me to see how I&rsquo;m doing in life instead of blabber-mouthing like this? Ryan Holiday writes a lot. But he writes actual articles. He writes blog posts. He writes things that other people want to read. I am not writing anything that other people would want to read. Heck, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend anyone read what I am writing right now. And yet I want to be like him. I want to be respected by others in the way I respect him. I want to be admired and looked up to like he is. </p>
<p>There must be people like me. People who want to do what Ryan Holiday does. To be like him. To be as erudite and well read as him. There must be others. But what is it we&rsquo;re trying to get, really? Is it that we want to be the most well-read people we know? I know I&rsquo;ve said that&rsquo;s what I want. But is that really what I want? To be the smartest person in the room? Well, yeah. I do want that. But I don&rsquo;t have to become the smartest person in the room simply by surrounding myself with idiots. Being the smartest person in the room might mean actually being the <em>least</em> intelligent person in the room most of the time. It means stretching yourself by being around others who push you. Who shine a light on your weaknesses. </p>
<p>I act like an introvert. I identify with the &ldquo;introvert&rdquo; personality. I don&rsquo;t really know how to &ldquo;play&rdquo; socially. I find it easier to be social when I have a &ldquo;mission.&rdquo; When there&rsquo;s a question I want to answer, or something I want to get from other people, then it becomes a lot easier to communicate with people. Because then I have an intent. But if I don&rsquo;t have an intent when I am around others, I feel lost. Anyway, what I was trying to get at is the fact that identify with introverts</p>
