<h1>I quit taking stabs...<br></h1>

<br />

<p>February, 2015...</p>

<p>I’m about to embark on a journey I never thought I’d take.</p> 

<p>Doing so will require behavior I’ve turned my nose at for years. 

<p>But the opportunity is immense. 

<p>To continue scoffing at what is required would be foolish. It would mean settling for mediocrity.

<p>I will not – I cannot – allow that.

<p>Besides, what identity am I so wedded to that makes this change distasteful?

<p>In all honesty, I don’t know. It’s vague and ill-defined.

<p>And I think it may be time to give it up.

<p>So, what am I talking about?

<p>Direct-response copywriting for the financial market.

<p>To be clear, the ‘direct-response copywriting’ part isn’t distasteful in the least. I’ve been studying the masters of this profession for months already. 

<p>It’s the 'financial market’ bit that puts me off.

<p>See, I’ve never followed the market.

<p>My parents (at least one of them) are self-described Marxists.

<p>And the biggest thing is…

<p>Since reading The 4-Hour Work Week at 18, I’ve put absolutely no effort into keeping myself “informed.” Not in the usual sense, anyway.

<p>Make no mistake, I’m a complete nerd when it comes to the things that interest me. 

<p>Health… fitness… psychology… copywriting… 

<p>I devour everything I can about these subjects. I look down every rabbit-hole. I’ll read every book, blog and publication I can get my hands on.

<p>But the news? No thanks.

<p>I haven’t got a clue about what’s going on in the world. Couldn’t even tell you what’s going on in our own country.

<p>And I’m averse to trying to figure it out.

<p>I want to read books, not the news. I don’t really want to spend part of every day just keeping up with the world. I’d much rather hunker down with a book about the history of the market than hack through the endless content that represents the state of the market today.

<p>But if I refuse to do that, I’ll get nowhere in this trade.

<p>So the question is… 

<p>What are the essential habits, the daily routines and information-consumption rituals of the top copywriters in this field?

<p>How do they do all this and leave room for other interests, pursuits and hobbies?

<p>That’s what this journal is all about. It’s where I’ll answer these questions, and where I’ll post my progress as I wade into this brand-new world.

<p>I’ll leave it at that for now, though, because I’ve got to run. The cafe I’m in is closing.

<p>But I’ll be back shortly.

<p>'Til then,

<p>Julien
