<p>I tend to jump online assuming that I can find better and more immediate information here than in a book. Ironically, I do this precisely when seeking advice about how to <em>stop</em> doing this. 
<p>Since I inevitably come across a ton of useful information, I’ve compiled a list of books, blog posts, and online articles concerned with strategies for reading comprehension and information management. Some of these are aimed at academics, some at young entrepreneurs, and others at content marketers and bloggers. 
<p>Regardless, you’re sure to find something useful in the links below.
